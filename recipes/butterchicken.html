    <div>DESCRIPTION :</div>
    
    <p>Butter chicken, also known as "Murgh Makhani" in Hindi, is a beloved and iconic dish in Indian cuisine that embodies a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. This creamy and indulgent dish features tender pieces of chicken, typically marinated in a mixture of yogurt and aromatic spices such as garam masala, ginger, garlic, and chili powder. After marinating, the chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) to achieve a smoky, charred flavor. However, it can also be prepared on a stovetop or in an oven.</font></p>
    
    <p>The pièce de résistance of butter chicken is its rich tomato-based gravy. Tomatoes are simmered to perfection with additional spices, cream, and a generous amount of butter, which imparts a luxurious and velvety texture to the sauce. This combination of spicy marinated chicken and the luscious, slightly sweet, and tangy tomato gravy creates a dish that's incredibly flavorful and comforting. Butter chicken is typically garnished with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and served with naan bread or fragrant basmati rice, making it a mouthwatering delight that has captured the hearts and palates of people around the world.</font></p>
